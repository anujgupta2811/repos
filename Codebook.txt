Variables :

- test_or_train : Vector which defines whether the data to be read is test or train dataset.

- merge_dataset : Data Frame which contains the merge data from test and train dataset.

- features : Dataframe which reads features.txt file which contain list of all features.

- activity_labels : Dataframe which reads activity_labels.txt file which links the labels with their activity name. 

- subject : Dataframe which reads subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt contains volunteer id performing the activity. Values range 1:30

- x : Dataframe which reads the dataset X_train.txt and X_test.txt

- y : Dataframe which reads the labels y_train.txt and y_test.txt

- y1 : Dataframe which is the Equi:Join of two dataframe y and  activity_labels.

- i : Integer used to loop the 561 features present in features.txt file.

- Signal : Dataframe which has features having 3 axial direction from merge_dataset.

- Magnitude : Dataframe which has features having Magnitude from merge_dataset.

- Signal_Dataset : Dataframe contains the tidy data with the average of each variable for each subject and activity having 3 axial direction.

- Magnitude_Dataset :  Dataframe contains the tidy data with the average of each variable for each subject and activity having Magnitude features
